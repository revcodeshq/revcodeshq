# 👋 Hi, I’m Joel

I’m a web developer and Discord bot developer focused on building clean, reliable, and maintainable solutions.

I mainly work on modern websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as custom Discord bots built with Node.js for moderation, automation, and integrations. My approach is to keep things simple, well-structured, and easy to scale without unnecessary complexity.

I’m currently building real-world projects and growing my portfolio. I’m open to collaborations and freelance work, especially projects that need clarity, structure, and dependable execution.
